## Overview

Completed Frontend Mentor challenge with working email capture functionality using Supabase backend. Email addresses are fully validated and duplicate submissions are denied at the db. Once submitted, a modal popup is displayed to inform users and the form is reset upon closure.

Note - security is weak due to exposed db key. For demo purposes only.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
